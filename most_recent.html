                        It is said that the average person goes through 5-7 career changes in their lifetime with 10-13
                        job in their lifetime. Once upon a time it was considered a bad thing to jump job to job. Long
                        term employment and employees were cherished and rewarded. Fancy crystal bric-a-brac at
                        milestones for years served and a gold watch at retirement were the norm for those in the
                        "boomer" generation. Today, with the proliferation of globalization and hedge fund acquisitions,
                        the average worker can be looked upon as a labor resource to be cut to help the bottom line. In
                        tech, long term employment on a resume is seen as a negative, indicating a lack of resolve
                        toward career advancement and personal growth. Within some tech circles, there is a justified
                        push toward diversity in the sector with "BlackTech" and "WomenWhoCode" seeing steady traction
                        on social media. There is one demographic that continues to see challenges in
                        hiring...middle-agers and seniors.<br><br>

                        I had dabbled in web design back in the early 2000's as a
                        freelancer, making websites for small businesses locally, mostly Photoshop/Dreamweaver work
                        really. I was self-aware about what my chances would be in a real tech environment. I didn't
                        know any code(Dreamweaver would do that for me). JavaScript?...forget it. When I decided to
                        learn web dev like the big kids, I knew it meant being serious about codeing. This is my story
                        about becoming real.<br><br>

                        In the interest of total transparency, I should first proclaim myself as a rising Gen X'er. Born
                        in '67 in northern California, I'm probably the picture of a child of the Boomer generation. My
                        mom comes from a middle class, blue collar Catholic family. My dad was the youngest of 5
                        brothers and the only Boomer of the bunch (all his brothers fought in WW2). Mom was a homemaker;
                        dad was in radio/television broadcasting...totally middle class. My parents divorced when I was
                        6. Mom would remarry, moved us to Central California where her new husband was a teacher. Dad
                        also remarried and moved to Hawaii to take a management job with the ABC affiliate. During my
                        childhood, I lived with my mom in Monterey CA, spending parts of summers in Honolulu with
                        dad...pretty choice really. I graduated from high school in '85 but, not being a motivated
                        student, college was not for me. I had other plans.<br><br>

                        While in high school, a Catholic boy’s school in Salinas (don't feel bad for me...the girl’s
                        school was three blocks away), I discovered music. It was the early 80's and new wave/punk was
                        in full swing and I wanted to be a drummer. So, my friends and I started a ska/punk(ish) band,
                        and, much to my detriment, it took off and I was hooked. No college for me. When I say took off,
                        it was only locally, but to us it was huge. We would play local night clubs and high schools
                        (once upon a time school dances had bands), occasionally playing up in San Jose. After
                        graduation, I moved into a loft space with the band and spent the next two years gigging on
                        weekends and bussing tables during the week. But like all things rock and roll, it ended in
                        tremendous fashion and it was back home with the parents. I spent the late 80's playing with a
                        decent local band, which hooked me up with a band from Florida that was passing through to San
                        Francisco to try their hand at that market. A few years later I would join them and start what
                        was the high-water mark of my music career. Through the early 90's we (The Meices for those
                        curious) toured the US and Europe, opening for the Grunge hipster acts of the time. I thought
                        this would be my career...then my back went out. I left the band in '95 to deal with it. I would
                        continue to have a go at success with various bands, who were all very good, but nothing that
                        would catch that "lightning in a bottle".<br><br>

                        During the late 90's, my girl and I got married and I went to work in the corporate offices of
                        The Sharper Image as the shipping and receiving manager (also known as the mailroom). A fine job
                        at the foot of Broadway in San Francisco. I lived in Oakland with my wife and would take the
                        ferry into SF (fuck BART...what a mess). I was still playing music, but I knew I was going to
                        have to figure something out long-term. The first dotcom boom went into full swing, but the web
                        wasn't on my radar. I had taken some video production classes in high school and found I really
                        liked editing, so I started looking into that as a career. I took classes at the Learning Annex
                        in SF. I had never used a computer in a serious manner but took to it well. All around me web
                        businesses were opening and getting tons of venture capital and SF was booming. Anyone that knew
                        html had a job, paying well. Businesses would close to turn their spaces into dotcom office
                        spaces. It was a heady time, until the money men figured out the market potential at the time
                        wasn't accurate...and the bottom fell out.<br><br>

                        None of this affected me, I wanted to be an editor. In late '99 I started going to a media
                        school with intent purpose of learning the tricks of the trade, which was what I was told would
                        happen. It turns out the major focus of this school was to be 3D animation (Pixar/Lucas type
                        stuff) ...not what I was sold. Still, I went with the flow and finished the 14-month intensive
                        program in early 2001. I wasn't a bad animator, but not special either. Fortunately, they did
                        have a parallel track of digital learning that was outside of animation. I learned the basics of
                        publishing, CD-ROM production, graphic design and... web design (Dreamweaver...no code). I went
                        to work at local editing house that specialized in corporate video and other marketing
                        materials. They had staff for editing and motion graphics but didn't have anyone for web and
                        CD-ROM production. So that's the niche I filled there.<br><br>

                        While I was in school, my wife got pregnant with our son, she was in administration for a small
                        telecom company and had the ability to work remote. That small company would get bought by a
                        larger company, who would in turn be bought by AT&T, so she was making good money. Nick was born
                        in 2000, while I was working at the editing house. The thinking being, probably naively so, that
                        she could work remote and raise Nick. About 6 months in we realized that doesn't work. The
                        financials of the household were such that I could become a stay-at-home dad...which I did...for
                        the next 18 years. Then we got pregnant with our daughter and started thinking we should look a
                        buying a house. The economic reality was that if we were to do that, we would have to do two
                        incomes and daycare at early ages, which we wanted to avoid if possible. So, after a visit with
                        family in the South, we decided to move...<br><br>

                        ...to Atlanta. My wife still worked remote and could live anywhere and do her job. We bought a
                        house in suburbs and raised our two kids. I would hook up with a small computer shop who wanted
                        to expand their services to include web design. For the next 5 years I would knock out simple,
                        static websites for mom and pop operations who wanted a web presence at a cheap price. It was
                        low rent tech wise. I would build it in Photoshop, slice it, export to html. All table/image
                        based. One client, a church, hired me to do maintenance on their site that someone else built
                        but wouldn't finish(?). My work with this client grew to include a few more websites, producing
                        a TV show, running the audio booth during services, work the live streaming, etc. I was able to
                        work two days a week, make decent money, raise the kids...then the pastor/president/founder of
                        the church got arrested for sexual assault on a child. It's very interesting to watch a church
                        collapse. It's not quick...it's like a slow-motion crash.<br><br>

                        In 2015, it became clear that the church wouldn't survive (at the time of writing this the
                        pastor is in prison). So, I decided to become a student. I enrolled at a local junior college
                        that had as "computer science" program that included a "web application" track. I had no idea if
                        I had real aptitude for the code side, but I gave it a shot...and kicked ass. Well, as much ass
                        as you can kick where I was going. I never really did my homework on what the industry was doing
                        tech wise, the school was blowing smoke at me that I was learning what I needed to get a job.
                        The reality was, that, if the tech knowledge necessary was 1000-page book, this school covered
                        10 pages. I've learned more in 2019 with online programs than semesters at school. I even had a
                        developer friend, who owns a successful company, tell me to not bother finishing that school (I
                        did because I was almost done...now I have a piece of paper on my wall with shiny letters). I
                        wish I'd started side study on my own while in school. Oh well.<br><br>

                        So here I am now a married (23 years), middle aged man who home schooled his son through high
                        school (who is now 19 and self-teaching computer science, Python and math mostly.He hopes to get
                        into AI someday. Daughter is 17, about to graduate high school), and ready to have the job hunt
                        kick me in the face. Bring it!<br><br>

                        I hope to expand on some of the events above, but mostly I want to document my experience
                        worming my way into tech. Maybe I'll grow this to YouTube...perhaps tutorials someday (I don't
                        think I'm in any position to give any advice right now...unless it's kind of advice that gets an
                        "OK BOOMER" reaction). But for now, it's a daily slog through the coding maelstrom in hopes that
                        someone out there gives this kid with a dream a shot.<br><br>
