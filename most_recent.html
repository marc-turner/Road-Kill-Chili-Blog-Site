                        In the spring of 2015, I decided to go back to school. As noted in post one of this site, I had passed on going to college out of high school in the 80's to become a famous musician, tour the world, be wildly wealthy. Clearly, this did not come to pass. In the 90's, going into the job field became more immediate than school, even though I had put on my resume I graduated college...nobody cared. Subsequent years were spent being a stay at home dad and freelance digital handyman. One client would grow to take up more of my time and eventually become my only client. It was a church here in Georgia that was very serious about it's outreach beyond the state, producing a TV/Radio show and multiplatform online presence. In 2014, the 76 year old founder and pastor(and my boss) was arrested for sexual assault on a minor and it became clear that this gig was coming to an end(he would eventually go to prison for 10 years). Freelance work being what it is, I wanted to find a situation that would be more of a steady income a job with a company can offer. That meant learning to code with the big kids.<br><br>

Going back to school later in life, there are some things you find important. For me, going to school meant finding a way to cut to the chase in regards to what I would be learning. I had no interest in doing the four year school if it meant having to do two years of general ed classes that I'd never need. There was an option that would provide some kind of degree in a short amount of time. Here in Georgia, as well as other states, there are two year undergraduate schools that specialize in technical training of many sorts, nursing, HVAC, construction, and computer sciences. In this state they are considered schools of applied sciences, or technical schools. The CS specialties they offer are programming, security, networking, and computer sciences(which I signed up for).<br><br>

Keep in mind that I had skipped college. Well, that's not altogether true. I think I took two semesters back in the mid-eighties at a junior college in California, so I had a few credits to my name, but I spent more time with my friends at the beach drinking beer that studying. I also went to a immersive digital media school for animation at about the turn of the millenium. I did pretty well scholastically, my animation skills were kind of weak and I never pursued a career in it. So here I am many years later, not sure if I could swing a more traditional school situation. I figured a technical school might be a good entry point and, if I did well, maybe I'd go on to a four year school for computer science.<br><br>

So I registered and it became pretty apparent that their curricullum is based on the idea that you know absolutley nothing about computers, at least at first. This lends itself to being very simple and a waste of time for those who come to the table with skills and experience. But I was patient through the first year and worked though them, basically aceing those classes. My focus was to learn to become a better student before the harder programming classes kicked in.<br><br>

I had started in thier programming path...Java. Honestly I was kind of lost. Not that the teachers were bad, but I took the intro course during the summer, which was a shorter time frame and much more intensive. I got lost pretty quick but still did well in the end...not sure how though. Everyone had to take basic front end(html/css) which I killed at. Intermemdiate Java was another lost cause, mostly because I wasn't grasping OOP. Again, I passed the class somehow, but began to realize that maybe Java wasn't for me. Falling back to web development looked like an excellent option. So I transfered my focus to the web application development specialization, which meant "advanced" html/css, JavaScript and PHP.<br><br>

Long story short...I wound up doing realy well be the schools standards, end with a cummulative grade of 3.5. The web dev stuff came very easy to me. In hindsight, I understand why...because it was easy and incomplete. If the knowledge to be competetive in the job market is a 1000 page book, this school taught 10 pages. I recall a local TV news story here last year. The story was on how the Governor was touting his technical schools in effort to create a mentoring program in the industries they teach. The story featured a local dev who said it was a great idea because "the students coming out of the schools didn't have the skills they were looking for". At the time I was a bit snarky about it. "They just don't want to take the time to train" I thought. Now I understand how short I was with my education. Nobody is going to teach you everything. You have to come to the table with something.<br><br>

So began my self-teaching experience...but that's for next post...<br><br>
